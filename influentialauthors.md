Newton saw further "by standing on the shoulders of giants." Maybe I can do the same. It's good to have giants - people whom we may aspire to emulate. That sort of inspiration is important in all aspects of life, not just work. Here are some of those people, listed in no particular order of influence or importance.

###Atul Gawande
Author of <em>Complications</em> (among other acclaimed works), surgeon, scientist.
<p class="message">"Better is possible. It does not take genius. It takes diligence. It takes moral clarity. It takes ingenuity. And above all, it takes a willingness to try."</p>

###Gary Vaynerchuk
A man who hustles, sweats positivity, and loves challenges. He is Inspiration, wearing a crewneck.
<p class="message">"If you live for the weekends and vacations, your shit is broken."</p>

###Michael Pollan
Vegetable vindicator and foo(d)-fighter. His words fork lightning and will make you clean out your fridge, which would probably be more beneficial than taking your PPI.
<p class="message">"Don't eat anything incapable of rotting."</p>

###Mary Lasker
Activist and force of nature. She's the reason the NIH and Planned Parenthood are Things. You're welcome, public health.
<p class="message">"Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes. I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."</p>

###Randall Monroe
Creator of XKCD, answerer of ridiculous questions. A guy who relieves science of its distracting illusion of tepidity.
<p class="message">"When you see a claim that a cancer drug or vitamin kills cancer cells in a petri dish, keep in mind: so does a hand gun."</p>

###Hans Clevers
Cell biologist, entrepreneur, god of developmental signaling. You should read about him before he is awarded the Nobel, not after.
<p class="message">"Itâ€™s very arrogant to think we can reconstruct [evolution] in our minds"</p>
