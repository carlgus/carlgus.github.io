<h1>Welcome</h1>  
<p>
I'm a graduate student at the Mayo Clinic. My thesis work is being done in Michael Yaszemski's laboratory, and is under the umbrella of the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.
<br/>
<br/>
While my Ph.D. research is aimed at developing better therapies for cancers (an admirable goal, to be sure), I care about a lot of other things as well. I am persuaded of the radical notions that we should pursue massive genome editing strategies to cure human diseases, that healthier lifestyles would nearly eliminate most other maladies not ameliorated by the previous strategem, and that a good research scientist is 10% activist, 20% entrepreneur, 30% raconteur, and 40% tactical mastermind.
<br/>
<br/>
Caring about all those things means that my Primary Objective is to actively work towards delivering smarter, more integrated, and faster tools to research scientists. The frequency at which researchers in medicine fail-forward needs to be accelerated as quickly as possible. Next generation research tools of many sorts are they best way to make that happen.
<br/>
