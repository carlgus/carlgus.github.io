<h1>Welcome</h1>  
<p>
I'm a Senior Fellow at the University of Washington. I work in the Bioengineering Department under the direction of Cecilia Giachelli. The research in our lab is directed at developing solutions for vascular calcification, which is the number one cause of mortality among chronic kidney disease patients. Put simply, when your kidneys break, lots of Bad Things happen. We are trying to fix some of the worst of those Bad Things.

My doctoral degree was completed at the Mayo Clinic with Michael Yaszemski. To read about that experience, visit my Ph.D. page.
<br/>
<br/>
On occasion, I write fairly opinionated blogs about science and health (opinions which I feel both required and qualified to have). Some of those blogs can be seen here.
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of exciting things are happening in the science world and I keep a running list of interesting research studies, opinions, and news. Check it out here.
