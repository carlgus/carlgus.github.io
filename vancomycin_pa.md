<p>Roughly 3% of all surgeries result in a post-surgery infection at the incision site. Some surgeries tend to be safer, and some (e.g. colorectal procedures) really inflate that number. Still it's an awfully high risk. Many spinal surgery teams use powdered antibiotics (i.e. vancomycin) to help reduce the likelihood of infection, a strategy which has been proven to be safe and effective.

Powdered antibiotics tend to not stick around in the wound for very long though, which limits their efficacy, and requires surgical teams to use way more drug than is actually needed. That extra drug means an increased risk of complications from the antibiotic (like an immune reaction). So we made a hydrogel that can be placed in the wound and release the antibiotic for a while to help keep the drugs where we need them for as long as possible.

That seemed to work pretty well, so we characterized the hydrogels physical properties, and their affinity for the antibiotic. In collaboration with the Clinical Pharmacokinetics Lab at Mayo we also quantified and modelled the hydrogel's ability to release the drug. Subsequently, we got connected with Robin Patel's Clinical Microbiology group and did some analysis demonstrating the efficacy of the hydrogels at killing strains of MRSA. That study was published in PLoS One last winter. We are also working on a video-format methods article (currently In Press with the journal <em>JoVE</em>) that demonstrates how to make the hydrogels. Hopefully it will help other scientists find better ways to deliver antibiotics and eliminate infections that complicate recovery after surgery.
