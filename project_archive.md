<h3>Characterizing osteosarcoma responses to Wnt inhibition as a chemotherapeutic measure</h3>

<em>^^ that's the tentative title of my dissertation.</em>

Osteosarcoma is a pediatric bone cancer that affects ~1000 people in the U.S. every year. That's not very many people (when it comes to cancers, at least), which means there hasn't been a whole lot of incentive to find better treatments for osteosarcoma...[(continue reading)](/osteosarcoma_pa)

<h3>Extended, local vancomycin delivery as a solution to surgical site infection</h3>
Roughly 3% of all surgeries result in a post-surgery infection at the incision site. Some surgeries tend to be safer, and some (e.g. colorectal procedures) really inflate that number. Still it's an awfully high risk...[(continue reading)](/vancomycin_pa)

<h3>TIPS-synthesized hydrogels as scaffolds for tissue regeneration applications</h3>
Porous structures for tissue engineering applications are ideal for cell adherence and nutrient diffusion. While similar properties are desirable for cell growth, suitable structural characteristics vary between applications...[(continue reading)](/tips_pa)
