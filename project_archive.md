###Characterizing osteosarcoma responses to Wnt inhibition as a chemotherapeutic measure

<em>^^ that's the tentative title of my dissertation.</em>

Osteosarcoma is a pediatric bone cancer that affects ~1000 people in the U.S. every year. That's not very many people (when it comes to cancers, at least), which means there hasn't been a whole lot of incentive to find better treatments for osteosarcoma...[(continue reading)](/osteosarcoma_pa)

###Extended, local vancomycin delivery as a solution to surgical site infection
Roughly 3% of all surgeries result in a post-surgery infection at the incision site. Some surgeries tend to be safer, and some (e.g. colorectal procedures) really inflate that number. Still it's an awfully high risk...[(continue reading)](/vancomycin_pa)

###TIPS-synthesized hydrogels as scaffolds for tissue regeneration applications
Porous structures for tissue engineering applications are ideal for cell adherence and nutrient diffusion. While similar properties are desirable for cell growth, suitable structural characteristics vary between applications...[(continue reading)](/tips_pa)
