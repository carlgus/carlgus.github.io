title: About Carl
---

The Mayo Graduate School (of Mayo Clinic College of Medicine) has been my home for the last 4.5 years, and I'm preparing to present my dissertation / defend (coming Spring 2017).

My thesis work has been done in Michael Yaszemski's laboratory, and is under the umbrella of the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. The Yaszemski Lab has a significant arm of research studying better therapies for osteosarcoma, a primarily pediatric bone tumor. Those aims are what my thesis projects have been focused on, and you can read about some of that work in my [Project Archive](/project_archive) - it's a compilation of the projects I've worked on, written informally.

The Yaszemski Lab also does a lot of work using various synthetic polymers as scaffolds and drug delivery vehicles in regenerative applications. I've been involved in a few of those projects and you can read about them in the Project Archive as well. Or you could check out the linked publications.

####Work in cell signaling / osteosarcoma

* [in preparation: characterization of tankyrase-mediated cell death in osteosarcoma. <em>stay tuned!</em>]

####Work with polymers

* [vancomycin delivery with synthetic hydrogels] (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0146401)
* [TIPS hydrogel project] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4792294/)  

##Ventures

With the support / advice / healthy skepticism of my brothers (coincidentally, fellow researchers), I launched a startup called SlateQ, aimed at creating a better Author Services marketplace for scientists. Most researchers encounter a language barrier when trying to publish their work. The current tools to help them jump that hurdle are poorly executed, random, expensive or all of the previous. SlateQ is a distributed hub of active researchers available to help other researchers communicate more clearly and efficiently. After launching our initial product, and gaining interest from users, we're under further development to produce more powerful online connectivity. A well executed product is the only one worth delivering.

##Teaching
One of the best decisions I ever made was to accept a position as TA for Introduction to Regenerative Medicine (MPET 6820). The course directors and I were offered a chance to develop the course into a live-shared classroom with students and faculty at the Karolinska Institutet (SWE). With so much content to draw from, we were also able to obtain funding to create an interactive online tutorial series (complete with animated content and professional narration) with tiered information delivery relevant to anyone from lay-people to medical experts. The finished product is in production with the animation/web-dev vendor that has been working with our team.

##Writing

I often have opinions, and I like to write (and help other people write too). I've been working as an editor and manager of the Mayo Clinic [Diversity in Education Blog] (http://educationdiversityblog.mayo.edu) blog for a few years now, it's been a really cool experience to curate content from other students, and to contribute some of my own. Below is a list of some of the things of which I am more proud to have written.  

* [Treating cancer is awful] (https://medium.com/@carlgustafson/treating-cancer-is-awful-91738156ac8c#.4z6tcky4r)
* [Keep breathing] (http://educationdiversityblog.mayo.edu/discussion/dont-think-about-breathing/)
* [Accepting our own stupidity] (http://educationdiversityblog.mayo.edu/discussion/accepting-our-stupidity-and-having-fun-in-the-process/)  


##FAQs  
* Q: "What do you do in your free time?"
<p class="message">When I'm not in lab, you can usually find me searching for interesting coffees, running or biking (I used to run triathlon), or playing pickup volleyball when the opportunity presents itself. Canoeing and / or fishing are additional fan favorites.
</p>
* Q: "Do you have something lined up for after you graduate? (read: "can I hire you?")"
<p class="message"> I am currently available for hire. Hurry while supplies last!</p>
* Q: You're headed to a movie and can only bring in one snack. What do you choose??
<p class="message">Kettle corn is the snack of the gods. It's the perfect movie food. Although, sneaking a beer into a movie always makes me feel badass. Does beer count as a snack?</p>
