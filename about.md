title: About Carl
---

The Mayo Graduate School (of Mayo Clinic College of Medicine) has been my home for the last 4.5 years, and I'm preparing to present my dissertation / defend (coming Spring 2017).

My thesis work has been done in Michael Yaszemski's laboratory, and is under the umbrella of the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. The Yaszemski Lab has a significant arm of research studying better therapies for osteosarcoma, a primarily pediatric bone tumor. Those aims are what my thesis projects have been focused on, and you can read about some of that work in my [Project Archive](/project_archive) - it's a compilation of the projects I've worked on, written informally.

The Yaszemski Lab also does a lot of work using various synthetic polymers as scaffolds and drug delivery vehicles in regenerative applications. I've been involved in a few of those projects as well. For more details, check out the linked publications below.

<h3>Ventures</h3>

The Author Services market delivers inadequate assistance in a massively important space. We can do better. Globally, most researchers encounter a language barrier when trying to publish their work. The current tools to help them jump that hurdle are poorly executed, random, expensive or all of the previous. Our co-founders and myself launched SlateQ, a distributed, online hub of active researchers available to help other researchers communicate more clearly and efficiently. After releasing our initial product, and gaining interest from users, we're under further development to produce more powerful online connectivity. A well executed product is the only one worth delivering.

<h3>Teaching</h3>
One of the best decisions I ever made was to accept a position as TA for Introduction to Regenerative Medicine (MPET 6820). The course directors and I were offered a chance to develop the course into a live-shared classroom with students and faculty at the Karolinska Institutet (SWE). With so much content to draw from, we were also able to obtain funding to create an interactive online tutorial series (complete with animated content and professional narration) with tiered information delivery relevant to anyone from lay-people to medical experts. The finished product is in production with the animation/web-dev vendor that has been working with our team.

<h3>Writing</h3>

I often have opinions, and I like to write (and help other people write too). I've been working as an editor and manager of the Mayo Clinic <a href="http://educationdiversityblog.mayo.edu">Diversity in Education Blog</a> blog for a few years now, it's been a really cool experience to curate content from other students, and to contribute some of my own. Below are a few pieces of which I am more proud to have written.
